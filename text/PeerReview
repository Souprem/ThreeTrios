In that review, consider all the self-evaluation questions you have been asked during this course,
 and extrapolate from them the kinds of issues to examine. For example:

How flexible are the interfaces you were given?
How capable are the views?
How convenient was it to reuse their code?
How cleanly written and well-documented was their code?
If you needed to request changes from them, what were they and why were they needed?

 Design critique, implementation critique, documentation critique,
 design/code limitations and suggestions on how to address them.
