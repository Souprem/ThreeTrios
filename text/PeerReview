In that review, consider all the self-evaluation questions you have been asked during this course,
 and extrapolate from them the kinds of issues to examine.
Write a short (3-4 paragraph) review of their code.

Design Critique: How flexible are the interfaces you were given? (How convenient was it to reuse
their code?)
- The PlayerActionListener seems to be an interface for the controller to act as a listener
    for any player actions.
- Their model interface did not extend their ReadOnlyModel interface, so we had to have our adapter
    implement both interfaces to act as a full adapter for the model
Implementation Critique: How capable are the views?

Documentation and Style Critique: How cleanly written and well-documented was their code?
- Missing some documentation on the specific attack values for cards and their indexes
Design/Code Limitations and Suggestions:

Requested Changes: If you needed to request changes from them, what were they and why were they needed?
