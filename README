QUICK START:


KEY COMPONENTS:

SOURCE ORGANIZATION:


INVARIANT: currentPlayer cannot be null, it must be either Player.RED or Player.BLUE. As it is
            initialized in the constructor as Player.RED, and no methods have the ability to
            change currentPlayer to anything but Player.RED or Player.BLUE, this statement is
            a class invariant.
